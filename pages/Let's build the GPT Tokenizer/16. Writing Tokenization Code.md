# Writing Tokenization Code

### Writing Tokenization Code

In this section, we delve into the process of writing code for tokenization, which is a critical step in preparing text data for use in large language models (LLMs). Tokenization is the conversion of strings of text into sequences of tokens, which are essentially integers that represent chunks of text. This process is not straightforward and comes with complexities that can significantly impact the performance of LLMs.

#### Initial Character-Level Tokenization

The initial step in tokenization often starts at the character level, where we create a vocabulary of possible characters in a given dataset. For instance, considering a dataset containing Shakespeare's work, we might have 65 unique characters. We then map each character to a unique integer, creating a one-to-one correspondence between characters and integers.

```python
# Example of character-level tokenization
vocabulary = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, ...}
```

#### From Characters to Embeddings

To feed tokens into an LLM, we use an embedding table, which is a matrix where each row corresponds to a token's embedding vector. These embeddings are learned during training and provide a dense representation of tokens that the model can work with.

```python
# Example of using an embedding table
embedding_table = [[...], [...], ...]  # 65 rows for 65 tokens
```

#### The Need for Advanced Tokenization

Character-level tokenization is naive and not efficient for state-of-the-art LLMs. Instead, more complex schemes are used to create token vocabularies, often based on larger chunks of text rather than individual characters. This approach reduces the sequence length and captures more meaning in each token.

#### Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

The Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm is a popular method for creating a subword-level tokenization scheme. BPE iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or character sequences in the dataset, creating a new token for each merged pair. This process continues until a specified vocabulary size is reached.

#### Implementing BPE

To implement BPE, we start by encoding text into UTF-8 byte sequences, as most text data is represented in Unicode. After encoding, we apply the BPE algorithm to these byte sequences, compressing them based on frequency of occurrence. The result is a set of tokens that represent commonly occurring character sequences in the text.

```python
# Pseudocode for BPE implementation
def byte_pair_encoding(text):
    byte_sequence = utf8_encode(text)
    vocab = initialize_vocab(byte_sequence)
    while vocab_size < desired_size:
        pair_to_merge = find_most_frequent_pair(byte_sequence)
        byte_sequence = merge_pair(byte_sequence, pair_to_merge)
        vocab.add(new_token_for_merged_pair)
    return vocab
```

#### Encoding and Decoding

With a trained tokenizer, we can encode new text into token sequences and decode token sequences back into text. Encoding involves transforming text into a sequence of integers based on the BPE merges, while decoding reverses this process, reconstructing the original text from token sequences.

```python
# Encoding text into tokens
encoded_tokens = tokenizer.encode("Example text to encode")

# Decoding tokens back into text
decoded_text = tokenizer.decode(encoded_tokens)
```

#### Special Tokens

In addition to tokens generated from text, we often use special tokens to denote specific meanings, such as the start or end of a text. These special tokens are manually added to the vocabulary and handled separately in the tokenization code.

#### Conclusion

Tokenization is a foundational component in the preprocessing pipeline for LLMs. Writing tokenization code involves understanding the intricacies of character encoding, the principles behind algorithms like BPE, and the nuances of handling special tokens. By mastering tokenization, we ensure that LLMs receive data in a format that maximizes their potential for learning and generating meaningful text.
