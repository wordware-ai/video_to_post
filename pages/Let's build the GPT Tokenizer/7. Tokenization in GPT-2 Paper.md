# Tokenization in GPT-2 Paper

### Tokenization in GPT-2 Paper

Tokenization is a crucial pre-processing step in the use of large language models (LLMs), and it plays a significant role in how these models perceive and generate text. The GPT-2 paper introduced byte-level byte-pair encoding (BPE) as a method for tokenization, which is a more advanced approach compared to the naive tokenization methods.

#### Understanding Tokenization in GPT-2

The GPT-2 tokenizer operates on a byte level, meaning it takes the raw text data, which is initially a sequence of Unicode code points, and encodes it using UTF-8 to create a byte stream. The BPE algorithm is then applied to this byte stream, compressing it by iteratively merging the most frequent pairs of bytes and adding them as new tokens to the vocabulary. This process continues until a predefined vocabulary size is reached.

In GPT-2, the vocabulary size is set to 50,257 tokens, and the model's context size is 1,024 tokens. This means that during attention operations within the transformer architecture, each token can attend to up to 1,024 previous tokens, making token sequences the fundamental unit of information processing in LLMs.

#### The Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Algorithm

The BPE algorithm used in GPT-2 is a core component of the tokenization process. It starts with the raw byte stream of the text and looks for the most frequently occurring pair of bytes. This pair is then replaced with a new token, effectively reducing the length of the sequence while expanding the vocabulary. The process repeats, finding the next most common pair, merging them, and continuing until the desired vocabulary size is reached.

#### Practical Implications of Tokenization

The tokenization process has several practical implications for the performance of LLMs. For instance, issues with spelling, string processing, non-English languages, and simple arithmetic can often be traced back to the way tokenization is handled. The tokenizer's vocabulary and the way it chunks text into tokens can significantly affect the model's ability to understand and generate text accurately.

#### Building and Using a Tokenizer

In the video, the process of building a tokenizer from scratch using the BPE algorithm is demonstrated. This involves creating a vocabulary from a training set, establishing an embedding table for the tokens, and training the tokenizer to convert strings into sequences of tokens and vice versa.

#### Conclusion

Tokenization is a complex but essential aspect of working with LLMs. The GPT-2 paper's introduction of byte-level BPE for tokenization marked a significant advancement in the field. Understanding the intricacies of the tokenization process is vital for anyone working with LLMs, as it influences the model's capabilities and limitations in processing and generating human language.
