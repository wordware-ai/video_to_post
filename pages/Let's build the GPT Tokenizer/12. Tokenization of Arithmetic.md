# Tokenization of Arithmetic

### Tokenization of Arithmetic

Tokenization is the process by which raw text is converted into a sequence of tokens, which are the basic units that a language model (LM) understands and processes. This process is crucial for the performance of language models, especially when dealing with tasks that involve understanding and manipulating text at a character or symbol level, such as arithmetic.

#### The Challenge with Arithmetic Tokenization

Arithmetic poses a unique challenge for tokenization in language models because arithmetic operations are inherently character-level processes. For example, when adding numbers, humans typically align digits by their place value, carry over numbers during addition, and perform operations digit by digit. Language models that tokenize input into larger chunks may struggle with these tasks because the tokenization process can obscure the character-level details necessary for arithmetic.

#### How Tokenization Affects Arithmetic in LLMs

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 often tokenize numbers in a way that can be arbitrary and non-intuitive. During the tokenization process, a number like "127" might be tokenized as a single unit, while "677" might be split into two separate tokens, "6" and "77". This inconsistent tokenization can make it difficult for the model to understand and perform arithmetic operations correctly.

For example, if a model encounters the number "804", it may tokenize it into "8" and "04", treating these as two separate entities. When asked to perform arithmetic involving "804", the model must reconcile the fact that it's working with two tokens that it has learned to interpret as separate concepts, rather than as a single number.

#### Tokenization Schemes and Arithmetic

Different tokenization schemes can lead to different levels of performance in arithmetic tasks. For instance, character-level tokenization might be more suitable for arithmetic as it preserves the individual digits and their order. However, character-level tokenization can lead to very long sequences for large texts, which is computationally inefficient.

Advanced tokenization schemes like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) aim to strike a balance by creating a vocabulary of frequently occurring character chunks. BPE can help reduce sequence length while still preserving some character-level information. However, the way BPE chunks numbers can still be arbitrary, affecting the model's ability to perform arithmetic.

#### Improving Arithmetic Tokenization

The tokenization of arithmetic can be improved in several ways. One approach is to design tokenizers that are more sensitive to the structure of numbers. For example, ensuring that numbers are tokenized consistently, without splitting digits in a way that loses their numerical meaning, can help LLMs better understand and perform arithmetic.

In the case of GPT-4, the tokenizer was improved to be more efficient in handling numbers and Python code by grouping more whitespace characters into single tokens. This denser representation allows the model to attend to more context, which is especially beneficial for tasks like coding where whitespace is meaningful.

#### Implementing Arithmetic Tokenization

When building a tokenizer, one must consider how it will handle different types of text, including arithmetic. Implementing a tokenizer involves defining a vocabulary and creating rules for how text is split into tokens. For arithmetic, it's important to ensure that numbers are tokenized in a way that preserves their mathematical properties.

For instance, a simple tokenizer might split text into tokens based on whitespace and punctuation, but this approach could be problematic for arithmetic where whitespace isn't always meaningful, and numbers need to be kept intact. A more sophisticated tokenizer might use patterns or algorithms to identify numbers and tokenize them as whole units.

#### Conclusion

Tokenization is a foundational aspect of language model performance, with significant implications for tasks like arithmetic. The way a tokenizer handles numbers can either enable or hinder a model's ability to perform arithmetic operations. As such, careful design and implementation of tokenization strategies are essential for building LLMs that are competent in arithmetic and other tasks requiring fine-grained text manipulation.
