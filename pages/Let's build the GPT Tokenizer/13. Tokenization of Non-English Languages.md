# Tokenization of Non-English Languages

### Tokenization of Non-English Languages

Tokenization plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various languages. It is essential to understand that tokenization schemes significantly impact the model's ability to process and generate text, especially in non-English languages.

#### The Challenge with Non-English Tokenization

Tokenization can be particularly challenging for non-English languages due to several reasons:

1. **Training Data Imbalance**: LLMs like GPT-2 or GPT-3 are often trained on datasets predominantly composed of English text. This imbalance leads to a tokenizer that is highly optimized for English, at the expense of other languages.

2. **Complex Tokenization**: Non-English languages may have different grammatical structures, scripts, and character sets that complicate the tokenization process. For example, languages like Chinese or Korean do not use spaces to delimit words, and languages like Arabic have script-specific features like cursive writing and diacritical marks.

3. **Sequence Length Bloat**: When tokenizing non-English text, the resulting token sequences tend to be longer than their English counterparts. This bloat occurs because the tokenizer, trained predominantly on English data, fails to efficiently chunk non-English text. Consequently, the model has a shorter effective context length for non-English languages due to more tokens being used to represent the same content.

4. **Lack of Token Merges**: In English, common phrases or words might be merged into single tokens, reducing the sequence length. However, due to less frequent exposure to non-English phrases or words during tokenizer training, such efficient merges are less likely to occur, leading to longer token sequences for non-English text.

#### Example: Tokenization of Korean Text

Consider the Korean greeting "안녕하세요" (annyeonghaseyo), which means "hello." In an LLM trained predominantly on English, this phrase might not be efficiently tokenized. Instead of being represented as a single token or a small number of tokens, it might be broken down into a larger number of tokens, each representing smaller pieces of the phrase. This inefficient tokenization stretches out the representation of the phrase, consuming more of the model's context window.

#### Addressing Non-English Tokenization Issues

To improve tokenization for non-English languages, the following approaches can be considered:

1. **Balanced Training Sets**: Ensure that the training set for the tokenizer includes a representative mix of languages. This balance allows the tokenizer to learn more efficient token merges for a variety of languages, not just English.

2. **Specialized Tokenizers**: Develop language-specific tokenizers that are trained on large datasets of the target language. These tokenizers can better capture the nuances and common patterns of the language.

3. **Post-Training Adjustments**: After training a general tokenizer, make adjustments to the vocabulary by adding more tokens specific to non-English languages or by fine-tuning the tokenizer on a more balanced dataset.

4. **Increased Context Window**: Design LLMs with a larger context window to mitigate the impact of sequence length bloat for non-English languages.

5. **Script-Specific Preprocessing**: Apply preprocessing steps that are tailored to the writing system of the non-English language before tokenization. For example, segmenting text into words for languages that do not use spaces.

By taking these steps, we can create tokenizers that are more inclusive and performant across diverse languages, leading to LLMs that are truly global in their capabilities.
