# Building Our Own Tokenizer

### Building Our Own Tokenizer

In this section, we will explore the construction of a tokenizer, which is an essential component in working with large language models (LLMs). Tokenization is the process of converting strings of text into sequences of tokens, which are essentially atomic units that the model can understand and process.

#### Why Tokenization Matters

Tokenization might not be the most exciting aspect of working with LLMs, but it is crucial. It influences the performance of the model significantly. Issues that may seem related to the architecture of the neural network often trace back to tokenization. For instance, difficulties in spelling, string processing, handling non-English languages, or even simple arithmetic can often be attributed to the way text is tokenized.

#### The Naive Approach to Tokenization

Previously, we tokenized text in a very simplistic wayâ€”character-level tokenization. Each character in the text was mapped to a unique integer token. However, this approach is not practical for state-of-the-art models due to its limitations in efficiency and expressiveness.

#### Advanced Tokenization Schemes

Instead of character-level tokenization, modern LLMs use more sophisticated methods. These methods tokenize text at the chunk level, where chunks are sequences of characters that are often merged based on their frequency of co-occurrence in the training data.

One such method is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), which iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of tokens (or characters in the initial iteration) to create a new token. This process continues until a predefined vocabulary size is reached.

#### Implementing Byte Pair Encoding

To implement BPE, we start by identifying the most frequent pair of tokens in our dataset. We then replace all occurrences of this pair with a new token. This process is repeated, each time identifying and merging the next most frequent pair, until we have built a vocabulary of desired size.

Here's a simple Python function that finds the most common pair:

```python
def get_stats(vocab):
    pairs = collections.defaultdict(int)
    for word, freq in vocab.items():
        symbols = word.split()
        for i in range(len(symbols) - 1):
            pairs[symbols[i], symbols[i + 1]] += freq
    return pairs
```

And another function that merges the pair throughout the vocabulary:

```python
def merge_vocab(pair, v_in):
    v_out = {}
    bigram = re.escape(' '.join(pair))
    p = re.compile(r'(?<!\S)' + bigram + r'(?!\S)')
    for word in v_in:
        w_out = p.sub(''.join(pair), word)
        v_out[w_out] = v_in[word]
    return v_out
```

#### Training Our Tokenizer

With these functions, we can train our tokenizer on any corpus of text. We will encode the text into tokens using our BPE algorithm and create a lookup table that can be used to tokenize new text and convert token sequences back into strings.

#### Tokenization Complexities

Tokenization is not without its complexities. It involves understanding Unicode and UTF-8 encoding, dealing with various languages and scripts, and handling special characters like emojis. Moreover, the tokenizer must be trained on a representative dataset to ensure it can handle the text it will encounter in practice.

#### Conclusion

Building our own tokenizer is a step-by-step process that involves understanding the intricacies of text data and the requirements of LLMs. While BPE is a powerful tokenization method, it is important to be aware of the potential pitfalls and complexities involved in tokenization. With a well-trained tokenizer, we can significantly improve the performance and capabilities of our language models.
