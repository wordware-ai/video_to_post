# Naive Tokenization and Its Limitations

### Naive Tokenization and Its Limitations

Tokenization is the foundational process of converting raw text into a sequence of tokens that a language model can interpret. While it might initially seem straightforward, naive tokenization approaches often lead to numerous complications and limitations when working with large language models (LLMs).

#### What is Naive Tokenization?

Naive tokenization is the simple process of splitting text into smaller pieces or tokens based on a predefined set of rules. For example, one might split a text into tokens by using spaces and punctuation as delimiters. This rudimentary method is easy to implement but quickly encounters limitations when applied to the complex requirements of LLMs.

#### Limitations of Naive Tokenization

1. **Fixed Vocabulary Size**: Naive tokenization typically relies on a fixed vocabulary, often created by listing all unique characters or words in a dataset. This approach is inherently limited by the vocabulary size and fails to handle new words or characters that were not present in the initial dataset.

2. **Inefficient Representation**: Using character-level tokenization results in very long sequences for even moderately sized strings. For instance, a 1000-character text would result in a sequence of 1000 tokens, each representing a single character. This inefficiency becomes problematic when dealing with the fixed context sizes of attention mechanisms in transformers.

3. **Lack of Generalization**: Naive tokenization does not generalize well across different datasets or languages. It treats each character or word independently, ignoring the possibility of shared subword units across different words or languages, which could be used for more efficient representation.

4. **Handling of Unseen Text**: When a model encounters text that was not present in the training data, it struggles to tokenize and understand it, leading to poor model performance. This is especially problematic for LLMs expected to handle a wide variety of inputs.

5. **Complexity with Non-English Languages**: Naive tokenization schemes often fail to account for the complexities of non-English languages, which may not conform to the simple delimiters like spaces and punctuation used in English. This results in poor tokenization and, subsequently, poor model performance on non-English text.

#### Example of Naive Tokenization

Consider the text "hi there". A naive tokenizer with a character-level approach would tokenize this as a sequence of individual characters: ['h', 'i', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e'], each mapped to a unique integer in a lookup table. While this works for short texts, it becomes highly inefficient for larger texts and fails to capture the linguistic structure present in the text.

#### Conclusion

Naive tokenization is a starting point for understanding the tokenization process. However, it is inadequate for the needs of advanced LLMs. The limitations of naive tokenization necessitate the development of more sophisticated tokenization schemes that can handle variable-length sequences, generalize across languages, and efficiently represent the input text. Advanced tokenization techniques, such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), offer solutions to these challenges and are crucial for the development of state-of-the-art LLMs.
