# Advanced Tokenization Schemes

## Introduction

Tokenization is a fundamental process in the handling of data for large language models (LLMs). While we have previously covered basic character-level tokenization, state-of-the-art LLMs employ more sophisticated schemes to construct their token vocabularies. In this section, we will explore the complexities and motivations behind these advanced tokenization methods.

## The Need for Advanced Tokenization

The naive character-level tokenization, where each character is mapped to a unique token, is not efficient for large-scale text data. It results in long sequences of tokens for processing, which is computationally expensive and limits the context that a language model can consider. To address this, advanced tokenization techniques aim to reduce sequence length by representing frequent character combinations or even whole words as single tokens.

## Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

A popular algorithm for constructing advanced token vocabularies is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). BPE iteratively merges the most frequent pair of tokens into a single new token. This process continues until a predefined vocabulary size is reached. BPE effectively compresses the training data by reducing the number of tokens needed to represent it.

For example, the GPT-2 paper introduced byte-level BPE as a tokenization method. GPT-2 uses a vocabulary of 50,257 possible tokens, and the BPE algorithm is applied on the byte-level representation of UTF-8 encoded text. This allows GPT-2 to encode a large amount of text data efficiently, with a context size of up to 1024 tokens.

## Implementing BPE

To build our own tokenizer using BPE, we start by encoding our training data into UTF-8 bytes. We then apply the BPE algorithm to this byte stream. The algorithm looks for the most common pairs of bytes and replaces them with a new token, effectively compressing the data. The process is repeated iteratively, each time adding a new token to the vocabulary until the desired vocabulary size is achieved.

## Complexities of Tokenization

Tokenization is not straightforward and comes with its own set of complexities. For instance, the choice of vocabulary size is crucial. A vocabulary that is too small may not capture the nuances of the language, while one that is too large may lead to inefficiency and sparsity issues. Moreover, tokenization can impact the performance of LLMs in various tasks, such as spelling, arithmetic, and handling non-English languages.

Tokenization also affects the way LLMs process programming languages. For instance, Python code that uses indentation can lead to a bloated token sequence, making it difficult for the model to maintain the necessary context. This was a problem in earlier versions of GPT, which was later addressed in GPT-4 by improving the efficiency of whitespace tokenization.

## Conclusion

Advanced tokenization schemes like BPE are essential for the effective functioning of LLMs. They allow models to process large texts more efficiently and contribute significantly to the performance of LLMs in various tasks. Understanding the intricacies of tokenization is crucial for anyone working with LLMs, as it has a profound impact on the model's capabilities and limitations.
