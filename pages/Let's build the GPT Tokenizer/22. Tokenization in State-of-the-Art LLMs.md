# Tokenization in State-of-the-Art LLMs

### 22. Tokenization in State-of-the-Art LLMs

In the realm of large language models (LLMs), tokenization plays a critical role, serving as the bridge between raw text and the numerical representations that models can understand and process. Despite its complexity and the pitfalls it presents, a thorough comprehension of tokenization is indispensable for working with LLMs.

#### What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of converting strings of text into sequences of tokens, which are essentially atomic units that LLMs can interpret. Each token is an integer that represents a piece of text, such as a character, word, or subword. These tokens are then used to look up embeddings in a table, which are fed into the transformer model of the LLM.

#### Character-Level Tokenization

In a naive approach, we might start with character-level tokenization, where every character in the text is mapped to a unique integer token. For example, the string "hi there" could be tokenized into a sequence of integers representing each character. However, character-level tokenization is limited and doesn't scale well with the complexity of language, leading to inefficiencies in the model's understanding and generation capabilities.

#### Advanced Tokenization Schemes

State-of-the-art LLMs employ more sophisticated tokenization schemes that operate at the subword or chunk level. These schemes allow the model to handle a wider variety of words and phrases, including those that may not have been seen during training. One such algorithm used for constructing these token vocabularies is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE).

#### Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

BPE is an algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of tokens in the training data. It starts with individual characters or bytes as tokens and progressively merges them into larger chunks that represent common subwords or sequences of characters. This process allows the model to effectively handle common phrases and linguistic patterns while maintaining the ability to break down and understand rare or unseen words.

#### Tokenization in GPT-2 and GPT-4

The GPT-2 paper introduced byte-level BPE tokenization for LLMs. It established a fixed vocabulary size (e.g., 50,257 tokens) and a maximum context size (e.g., 1024 tokens) for its transformer neural network. In this architecture, each token attends to the previous tokens in the sequence, making tokens the fundamental unit of LLMs.

GPT-4 further improved upon this by increasing the number of tokens in its tokenizer, effectively reducing the token count for the same text. This densification allows the model to attend to a larger context, as each token now represents a larger chunk of text.

#### Building Your Own Tokenizer

One can build a tokenizer from scratch using the BPE algorithm. The process involves identifying and merging frequent pairs of tokens in the training data, creating a vocabulary, and then using this vocabulary to encode and decode text. This task requires careful consideration of the complexities involved in tokenization, such as the handling of special characters, different languages, and programming code.

#### Challenges and Considerations

Tokenization is not without its challenges. Issues such as handling spelling tasks, string processing, and simple arithmetic can be traced back to the tokenization process. Non-English languages and programming languages often suffer in performance due to the tokenization approach, as tokens may not align well with the syntactic and semantic structures of these languages.

Tokenization also introduces potential security risks. Special tokens, if not handled properly, can be exploited to produce unexpected or undesired behavior in LLMs.

#### Conclusion

Tokenization is a foundational aspect of working with LLMs. Despite its challenges, it is essential for transforming raw text into a form that models can process. As the field advances, there is a continuous effort to improve tokenization methods to enhance the performance, efficiency, and security of LLMs.
